# Changelog

This file records notable public changes to Better Harness. Entries describe
observable behavior and compatibility, not every internal refactor.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Kimi Code is now a supported analysis-capable source-local host. The
  repository installs as a Kimi Code plugin (`/plugins install <repo>`)
  through a `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json` manifest, gains a Kimi configured-asset
  provider (user `~/.kimi-code/skills` and `mcp.json`, project
  `.kimi-code/skills` and `.kimi/skills`, and managed plugins from
  `plugins/installed.json` with `enabled` filtering and plugin-root path
  confinement) plus a Kimi session-evidence adapter that reads
  workspace-matching wire transcripts under
  `~/.kimi-code/sessions/<wd_*>/ses{sion}_*/agents/*/wire.jsonl`, resolving
  the workspace mapping through `workspaces.json` and `session_index.jsonl`
  with a `wd_<name>_*` prefix fallback that records a
  `kimi-workspace-index-absent` warning. The public npm package now ships
  seven host metadata roots; the Qoder runtime bundle remains Qoder-specific.

- Pi (pi.dev) is now a supported analysis-capable source-local host. The
  repository installs as a pi package (`pi install <repo>`) through a `pi`
  manifest in `package.json`, registers a `/better-harness` prompt template,
  and gains a Pi configured-asset provider (settings-declared pi packages,
  skills, prompt templates, extensions, and `AGENTS.md` context) plus a Pi
  session-evidence adapter that reads workspace-matching JSONL v3 transcripts
  under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/` with `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` and
  `PI_CODING_AGENT_SESSION_DIR` overrides. Pi's shell is the `pi` manifest in
  the existing `package.json`, so the public npm package still ships six host
  metadata roots and the Qoder runtime bundle remains Qoder-specific.

### Changed

- The `harness analyze` platform gate now names the full supported set
  (`qoder, codex, claude, cursor, qwen, copilot, pi`) when it rejects an
  unsupported `--platform`, matching the session-analysis and asset-baseline
  gates. The existing error prefix and exit behavior are unchanged.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-27

### Changed

- The public npm package now includes the Qoder, Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor
  plugin metadata roots with aligned public descriptions. The generated Qoder
  runtime bundle remains Qoder-specific.
- CI now follows the `main` branch, and repo-local Agent Skills use `SKILL.md`
  directly without a mirror sidecar contract.
- Claude Code now defaults `/better-harness` to a validated, self-contained
  HTML report with paired Markdown and findings artifacts. Explicit inline or
  no-files requests remain write-free.

### Removed

- Removed pre-public identity aliases, migration-only specifications, and local
  compatibility readers. Better Harness is now the only product, CLI, plugin,
  callback, report-root, and session-reference identity.
- Removed developer-specific paths and obsolete compatibility commands from the
  public terminal-demo documentation.
